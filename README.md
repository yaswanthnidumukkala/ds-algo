# Data structures and Algorithms
## What is Good Code?
### Readable 📖
- Is your code clean and others understands it.
### Scalable 📈
- Does the code does not lag and perform well when inputs increase?

### BIG O 😲:
- There are many ways to solve a problem through code. Both efficient and inefficient ways.
- BIG O notation is used to measure the idea of scalable. Code that can scale.

- ⭐ALGORITHMIC EFFICIENCY: When we go bigger and bigger with the input, how much does the algorithm slows down? The lesser the better 💪

The time it takes for a program to run varies depending on the system configuration. So, how can we measure if the code is efficient? And what is a scalable code (the code does not lag and perform well when inputs increase)
- Big O notation is language we use to compare how long an anglorithm takes to run.
- Compare algorithms and say which one is better regardless of computer differences.
